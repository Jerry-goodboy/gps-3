# Notebooks

The notebooks in this folder serve to document the algorithms used to implement the Python prototype of the SDR GPS reciever. You can open them using Jupyter notebook and edit the code yourself, or if you just want to view them, they will render in Github. 

# Overview

GPS signal processing involves three major steps:

- Acquisiton
- Tracking
- Navigation data processing

As we work our way through each of these, a notebook will be created for each one to document the process. Near the completion of the Python prototype, the notebooks will be numbered for easier navigation.

## Status 04-06-17

The Gold Code Generator and Acquisition notebooks are the most complete. Tracking is a work in progress, and the others are not currently in active use.
