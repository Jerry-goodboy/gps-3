# GPS Docs

The files in this folder are intended to give a comprehensive overview of the development and usage of the SDR GPS reciever. The documentation assumes a certain level of technical knowledge at points, so it may be worth brushing up on Fourier analysis, and signal processing concepts before digging in. 

# Setup

You will need to download the Launch 12 data, and a generated data file, and put them in /resources before getting started. 

Download and install Python3, and then use pip to install numpy. The docs are viewable on GitHub, but if you want to edit the notebooks to gain a better understanding, you will need Jupyter notebook.
