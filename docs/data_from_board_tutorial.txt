# First clone these two repositories
$ clone https://github.com/psas/commander
$ clone https://github.com/psas/av3-fc ***inside of the "commander" repository***
    ***More documentation is found under the README.md files of each of these repositories***

# Download packages required to run a virtual environment and pyyaml package (you probably already have python3 and python-pip
$ sudo apt-get install python3 libyaml-0-2 python-pip virtualenvwrapper
  - close the terminal then reopen after virtualenvwrapper is installed

# Change to commander directory
$ cd commander

# Instantiate a vitrual environment and call the instance <name> (ex. cmdr)
$ mkvirtualenv <name>

# Install the python dependencies
(cmdr)$ sudo apt-get install python-dev libffi-dev
(cmdr)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Exit the virtual environment
(cmdr)$ deactivate

# Make the av3-fc repository submodules of commander repository
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update --recursive
$ cd av3-fc
$ git submodule update --init

# Instantiate a virtual environment and call the instance <name> (ex. av3fc)
$ mkvirtualenv av3fc

# Install python dependancies
(av3fc)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Switch back to cmdr virtual environment and go to commander directory
(av3fc)$ workon cmdr
(cmdr)$ cd ../commander
    ***If you want to see the open virtual environment sessions use: $ lsvirtualenv

# Execute secrets  (create a password). You can make it whatever you'd like - the default is "1"
(cmdr)$ ./init.py

# Run the flight computer application
(cmdr)$ python app.py

# Set up network port with a static IP address
Click the network indicator --> Edit commections... --> Wired connection --> Edit --> IPv4 Settings --> Method (dropdown) --> Manual
Under "Addresses" populate the fields with
    Address: 10.10.10.10    Netmask: 255.255.255.0 (or 24)    Gateway: 10.10.10.1
Click "Save"

# Open a browser window and navigate to the address that displayed after running "python app.py" It should be 0.0.0.0:5000
  The password is the password that you created when running "./init.py"
  
# Under the RNH tab click "[3] GPS ON"
      *** DO NOT TURN ON WIFI!!!*** We should really only turn on the GPS module, it is recommended we leave everything else alone!
      
# In the terminal go back into the av3fc virtual environment and get back into the av3-fc directory
(cmdr)$ workon av3fc
(av3fc)$ cd ../av3-fc

# Execute the files that record the data. Data will continuously record until CTRL+C.
(av3fc)$ make
(av3fc)$ ./build_for_flight.sh
(av3fc)$ ./fc

# To open the data file
(av3fc)$ ll -h
    locate the logfile that you want to look at, and you can monitor it's size progress by using
(av3fc)$ ll -h logfile-nnn
